1 - Build the GUI for the program
    * Used customTkinter
2- Create a database with sqlite
    * Connect the database with the GUI
3- Parse the database and plot the drawing of the truss while user are inputing data
    * Create a plot function
4- Create a frame that allows the user to see the database
5- Create computational functions for the analysis of the truss
    * Verify the internal stability of the truss
    * Find the degrees of freedom
    * Identify the known displacements(d = 0 in support reactions) by the highest number 
        to partitionate the structure stiffness matrix later
    * Establish member stiffness matrixes for each members
    * Generate the structure stiffness matrix
    * Determine the global components of the force and displacements using the structure stiffness equation.
    * Divide the load and displacement vector between the known external loads and displacements, 
        and the unknown loads and displacements.
    * Find the internal efforts in the members
    * Find the dof_code associated with each members to partitionate the matrix
    * Add results printing interface
