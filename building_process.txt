1 - Build the GUI for the program
    * Used customTkinter
2- Create a database with sqlite
    * Connect the database with the GUI
3- Parse the database and plot the drawing of the truss while user are inputing data
    * Create a plot function
4- Create a frame that allows the user to see the database
5- Create computational function for the analysis of the truss
    * Verify the internal stability of the truss
    * Find the degrees of freedom
    * Identify the known displacements(d = 0 in support reactions) by the highest number 
        to partitionate the structure stiffness matrix later
    * Establish member stiffness matrixes for each members
    * Understand the use of stiffness matrixes
